# cmdos - A command line "operating system" in C++

Is it an operating system or a kernel? Or neither? I'm not sure for now, but `cmdos` is a basic implementation of a command line "operating system" in C++. There's a working command line interface, and other features such as Lua programs and a filesystem are somewhat coded but not fully implemented.

## That's All

`cmdos` is an old project, so I don't have lots of plans for updating the code or adding new features. You can edit/change/fork at your wish. Thanks!
